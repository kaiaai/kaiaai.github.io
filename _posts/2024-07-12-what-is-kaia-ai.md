A Software Platform for Intelligent Robots.

This platform makes it easy for you to create simple robots with rich, intelligent functionality.

For example, you can make a pet robot - and make your pet robot play toys, patrol your place and entertain you with its antics - with relatively few lines of code and a piece of compatible hardware.

Or, you can make a home butler robot - and have your butler robot greet guests, deliver drinks and canapes and take away empty plates and trash.

As of 2024, Kaia.ai is based on ROS2, Arduino and a variety of computation and communication toolkits including MediaPipe, WebRTC, OpenCV as well as modern Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning tools.

Kaia.ai aims to hide and abstract the many complexities of ROS2 to help Kaia.ai software developers write applications easily and speedily. That said, Kaia.ai does require its software developers to be familiar with robotics basics at some minimal level.

Last but not least, Kaia.ai platform comes with a Skill Store (launch expected in 2025) where you can download and/or publish new skills for Kaia.ai-compatible robots to use.

Kaia.ai is an application-pending trademark wholly owned by REMAKE AI.

In its infancy stage as of the year 2024, Kaia.ai is evolving fast. In its present shape, Kaia.ai lets you run a ROS2 robot system with ROS2 SLAM and Navigation, where the robot, outfitted a [compatible low-cost LiDAR](https://github.com/kaiaai/LDS), runs Arduino on an ESP32 micro-controller that talks to a ROS2 PC over WiFi and microROS. 

Here are some pointers to learn more about Kaia.ai" and feel free to watch the accompanying video tutorials:
- if your robot is Arduino-based, start by downloading and forking this [firmware](https://github.com/kaiaai/firmware).
- install this [software pack](https://github.com/kaiaai/install) using Docker (Linux, Windows) or a Ubuntu PC.
- follow this [command sheet](https://github.com/kaiaai/kaiaai) to operate your robot
