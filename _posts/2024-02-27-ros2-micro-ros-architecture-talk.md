A [repost](https://remake.ai/blog/ros-embedded-wg-talk/) from the REMAKE.AI blog. On 2/27/2024 I had the pleasure of giving an invited technical talk for the ROS Embedded Working Group.

Please find the [talk slides here](https://remake.ai/assets/docs/ROS_Embedded_WG_talk_02_27_24.pdf).

I discussed the REMAKE.AI home robot open-source architecture, its integration with [eProsima](https://www.eprosima.com/) micro-ROS including the [hardware](https://makerspet.com) and [software platform](https://kaia.ai) components.

At REMAKE.AI, we are big users - and big fans - of micro-ROS. Many thanks to micro-ROS developers at eProsima for crafting this incredibly useful open-source software.
